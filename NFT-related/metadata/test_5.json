{"name":"Boron","description":"Boron is a metalloid chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in both the Solar system and the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals.","image":"https://gray-acute-wildfowl-4.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXBS6G6ZytV5mMxfpXGdr2CKfGzG38t1JZcypBkAfFpAs/test_5.png","external_url":"todo","attributes":[{"trait_type":"RAM","value":10810000000000000000},{"trait_type":"Level","value":2}]}
