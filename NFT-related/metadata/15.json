{"name":"Phosphorus","description":"Phosphorus is a chemical element with symbol P and atomic number 15. As an element, phosphorus exists in two major forms—white phosphorus and red phosphorus—but due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth. Instead phosphorus-containing minerals are almost always present in their maximally oxidised state, as inorganic phosphate rocks.","image":"https://gray-acute-wildfowl-4.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXBS6G6ZytV5mMxfpXGdr2CKfGzG38t1JZcypBkAfFpAs/test_15.png","external_url":"todo","attributes":[{"trait_type":"RAM","value":30973761998500000000},{"trait_type":"Level","value":3}]}
